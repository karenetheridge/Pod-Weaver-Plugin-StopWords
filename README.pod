=head1 Pod::Weaver::Plugin::StopWords

This is a L<Pod::Weaver> plugin for dynamically adding stopwords
to help pass the Pod Spelling test.
It does the L<Pod::Weaver::Role::Finalizer> role.

Author names will be included along with any
stopwords specified in the plugin config (F<weaver.ini>).

Additionally the plugin can gather any other stopwords
listed in the POD and compile them all into one paragraph
at the top of the document.
